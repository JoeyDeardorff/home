            <h1>Analysis</h1>
		  <br>
		  <a style="text-align: center;color: yellow;text-decoration: none;">GeoCities was a web hosting service that allowed for free websites to be created by users and browsed by interest. These interests were categorized into neighborhoods and cities, and the user could choose what neighborhood their page would belong in when creating it. Although these neighborhoods provided a basic idea of the type of content on websites in the neighborhood, there was no enforcement over the fact that all pages in a certain neighborhood must have content pertaining to the specific topic associated with it.
	GeoCities based sites allowed users, or “homesteaders” to create homepages for themselves or their interests, visit sites created by other users, chat with other homesteaders, access virtual bulletin boards for their communities, and eventually shop using real money on the GeoCities marketplace. Many users included their email on their page, allowing visitors to contact them personally. Another hallmark of a GeoCities site was the guestbook, which allowed users visiting the site to “sign in”, leaving their email, username, and a small note to be viewed both by the host and by other users. While signing the guest book was not compulsory, it was a way to interact with the host and other visitors, as the guest book can be viewed without signing it yourself. Many GeoCities sites also incorporated a visitor counter, which automatically increased whenever the site was viewed, allowing the host and visitors to know exactly how popular the page was.
	GeoCities users, also known as “homesteaders” and “GeoCitizens” used the service as a way to build and share websites based on interests. The accessibility of creating a GeoCities site was a huge part of its draw: it was free, relatively simple to use, and allowed users to be as creative as they wanted with their site by incorporating images, music, gifs, unique fonts, and colorful backgrounds.
	GeoCities was separated into neighborhoods based on interest, including Area51, dedicated to science fiction, fantasy, and conspiracy theories, Acropolis for sites involving education, reading, writing, and philosophy, Augusta for those interested in golf, Baja for adventure, BourbonStreet for topics like jazz and Cajun food, Broadway for theater, CapeCanaveral for STEM topics, CapitolHill for political discussions, CollegePark for college life, Colosseum for sports, EnchantedForest for kids websites, Eureka for small businesses, FashionAvenue for fashion, Heartland for family focused content, Hollywood for films, MotorCity for cars, Pentagon for the military, Petsburgh for pets, Pipeline for extreme sports, RainForest for environmentalism, SiliconValley for technology, SoHo for art, SouthBeach, which was billed as a "high-style hot spot for hanging out, meeting and greeting, seeing and being seen.", SunsetStrip for alternative music, TheTropics for travel, Arcade for video games, Tokyo for anime, WallStreet for finance, WestHollywood for LGBT focused sites, and Yosemite for outdoor activities. While these neighborhoods were meant to be ways to categorize pages by content and specific interests, there was no enforcement that the pages in a certain neighborhood must include content directly related to the intended use of the community.
	GeoCities websites allowed for the creation of user-curated communities based on interest or topic.
