        This site, which was categorized into the “Area51” neighborhood, which was intended to mainly be home to pages based on topics of science fiction and fantasy. The link to the “below the surface” portion of the page is displayed twice, showing a lack of experience with coding, as this is a simple and easily fixable error. Clicking one of these links brings you to a few more links, including ones for each of the sites hosts, Craig and Karen. Craig’s page opens with his playful fantasy of being “a great statesman, a rugby legend, and the future 'High Lord Dictator of the Universe ''”, before admitting that he is by his own admission more of a “grumpy old man in training”. Craig then writes about his qualifications as a zoologist, his work with the Lummi Nation, his faith, and his wife Karen. By viewing Karen’s page, we get a bit more information about her. She writes casually about her love of animals, her family, and of course, Craig. The third link on “below the surface” is a similar “about me” style page, however this one is written from the perspective of the family dog Libby, and tells the story of the life and eventual death of the pet. Further inspection of the “dolphin deeds” and “watery web” sub-pages, both of which are also displayed twice, reveals the very specific purpose of Delphenic Vibes: dolphins. Photos, essays, and related websites, all about dolphins. The simplicity and specificity of this site is exemplary of what the average person with a niche interest used GeoCities for.

        Moving on from the underwater haven of Craig and Karen, we have a different, but equally archetypical type of GeoCities page: the personal homepage of edgy teen Shaun Shukayr. Shaun’s page makes full use of GeoCities’ stereotypical style, with a page full of gifs, pop-ups, and questionable color combinations. This site has very little content, but what we do have gives us a pretty clear picture of the man himself. Gifs of spinning inverted pentagrams, a PNG of dripping blood, an image of the Metallica logo, and the Yahoo! Username “ROCKnROLL_Will_Never_Die” presents the persona of a true late 90s/ early 2000s goth. With just three lines of text on the page, we learn everything that Shaun wants people to know about him: he was born in Shreveport in 1982, he now lives in Sierra Vista, and he is homophobic (although he “doesn’t mind lesbians”). The bulk of the content on this page consists of photos of Shaun with his best friend Tamara, as well as a link to his guestbook, which allows visitors to the site to leave comments and notes. This particular site exemplifies the GeoCities homepage. It has no particular purpose other than providing visitors with basic information about the host, much like a social media profile. Shaun’s page provides us with a time capsule of early 2000s edgy teen culture, from the casual homophobia to the repeated image of a marijuana field that serves as the site's background.

                                This site exemplifies yet another hallmark of the early internet: the celebrity fan page. This page in particular is dedicated to photos of actor Matt Damon. The homepage exhibits the classic hyperactive GeoCities style, with flashing gifs, bright colors, and a mix of several different fonts. There are photos and audio clips of the actor, as well as a section for videos with the text “coming soon…”, however these videos never materialized, either due to the shut down of GeoCities or the simple loss of interest in maintaining the page by the host. The site also offers downloadable “Good Will Hunting” themed desktop themes, as well as a dedicated section for Matt Damon computer wallpapers, however these are also “coming soon!”. The page also contains a collection of links to other Matt Damon-centric fan pages, such as “MattNet”, “Crystal’s Matt Damon Page”, “Al’s Matt Damon Site”, “MattDamonFanPage.com”, and “Mattdamon.fr.fm”, a French language page on the actor. According to the host, more links will be coming soon, however I find that doubtful. While this page may seem simple and silly, in a world before every celebrity had a huge social media presence, fans had to find a different way to obsess over their every move, leading to the creation of many, many celebrity fan sites like this one. In fact, this practice still exists in a different form today with celebrity stan accounts on social media, collating every bit of information and media related to the owner’s favorite celebrity and often defending the actions of that celebrity when met with controversy or rivalry.
