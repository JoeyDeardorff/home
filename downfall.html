            <h1>Downfall</h1>
		  <br>
		  <a style="text-align: center;color: yellow;text-decoration: none;">Although GeoCities did not officially shut down until 2009, the downfall of GeoCities began in 1999 with its acquisition by Yahoo!. At the time of the acquisition, GeoCities was the third most visited website on the net and had roughly 4 million users, a significant portion of whom were angered by the new terms and conditions for use of the service put in place by Yahoo!. 
	The new terms of service imposed by Yahoo! Included the following section, giving Yahoo! “the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed.” If users did not agree to these terms, they would not be able to update or change their site in any way, and no new users could join without agreeing to these terms. This new rule caused some homesteaders to protest, leading to the creation of websites such as boycottyahoo.com. As these protests gained traction, Yahoo! Eventually created a post hoping to quell the anger of GeoCities users and clarify the intent of the new terms of service, saying "Yahoo does not own content you submit, unless we specifically tell you otherwise before you submit it. You license the content to Yahoo as set forth below for the purpose of displaying and distributing such content on our network of properties and for the promotion and marketing of our services.". Despite this, the actual language of the terms remained unchanged, leading some users to push the boycott further. Although this boycott is not what directly killed GeoCities, it was the beginning of the end for the free web hosting service. The boycott created bad press for the company, leading to a lack of profitability. To combat this, Yahoo! Began to change core aspects of GeoCities that had made it so attractive to users in the first place. The ability to create sites for free was limited by introducing a paid premium hosting service and slowing the speeds of sites using the non-premium version, the URLs were changed from numbers known as street addresses to contain the hosts Yahoo! Username, and the company introduced more aspects of commerce into the site, such as advertisements and watermarks.
	These changes caused the slow death of GeoCities over the next ten years. In April of 2009, Yahoo! Stated that GeoCities would be shut down. After this point, no new users could join, although pre existing sites remained accessible until October of 2009, when the service officially died. Yahoo! Continued to operate their premium web hosting service, but the company no longer offered any sort of free web hosting options, which had been the major draw and point of accessibility for GeoCities. The official reason for the termination of GeoCities was a lack of profitability, with the service having been purchased in 1999 for roughly 3.5 billion dollars and reporting an 8 million dollar loss in the last quarter of 1998 alone.
